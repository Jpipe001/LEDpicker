"Let's take it to the next level"

This allows you to easily pick colors when using ESP32 and a String of LEDs.

I have seen Color Charts with Hex Color codes and Decimal Color codes.

Using these can be difficult because you only know what you really have until you Upload the .ino file and especially difficult if you are using low brightness levels to conserve power.

But this combines everything thing together.

It provides easy color selection with sliders and displays:

Decimal Codes

Hex Codes

Color Box

Pressing the "Send Button" will upload the codes to an ESP32 with chain of LEDs and will light up the selected LEDs on that chain, so you know exactly what that color looks like.

If it is not quite right, move the Sliders again and press the Button to send new codes. 

And is fun to use!!
