I have seen Color Charts with Hex Color codes and Decimal Color codes.

Using these can be difficult because you only know what you really have until you Upload the .ino file and especially difficult if you are using low brightness levels to conserve power.

But this combines everything thing together.

It provides easy color selection with sliders and displays:

Decimal Codes

Hex Codes

Color Box

And will light up selected LEDs on a chain, so you know exactly the color selected.

If it is not quite right, move the Sliders again and press the Button to Send Codes. 

And is fun to use!!
